Apps from FinGameWorks and its sub-accounts (Contrail Software), 
including Diffuse, Skyline, Metropolis, Vortex, etc, were removed by Google following with complete account termination. 
I personally think it is not fair as I am proud of my indie apps, and I don't think there is any shady stuff or wrongdoing in my accounts. 
I tried to file an appeal, but obviously, Google Play rejects it without giving details and states their decision is final. 
(please follow this thread: https://twitter.com/JustZht/status/1432794022607671299) 
I am still trying to get my apps back through other means, or just publish them using another account, but it would take a while.

For refunds, I am still trying to find a way to make a refund because once the account is terminated, 
I can only log into the policy page saying my account is effectively dead, nothing more, not even seeing historical download and purchase data.

I am terribly sorry for the issue. 

Best,

UPDATE:  
- <del>As of 09/06/2021, Diffuse is up again as [a new app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justzht.lwp.diffuse) through re-submission. Other apps will be re-submitted, if time and situation permit.</del>
- As of 09/27/2021, FinGameWorks, the account holding the new Diffuse app is also banned (https://twitter.com/JustZht/status/1442619001331322886). Now I don't have Google Play dev account any more. I will probably open source my apps and publish them on F-Droid. It was a good time on Google Play with all kind users I interacted with.
- As of 10/28/2021, I still cannot get my account back and I am just too exhausted to still care. I have uploaded the latest version of Diffuse to [https://diffuse.app/](https://diffuse.app/), which if you click on the download button should lead to you to a self-hosted APK link.
