Apps from FinGameWorks and its sub accounts (Contrail Software), 
including Diffuse, Skyline, Metropolis, Vortex, etc, are removed by Google following with complete account termination. 
I personally think it is not fair as I am proud of my indie apps and I don't think there is any shady stuff or wrongdoing in my accounts. 
I tried to file an appeal but obviously, Google Play rejects it without giving details and states their decision is final 
(please follow this thread: https://twitter.com/JustZht/status/1432794022607671299). 
I am still trying to get my apps back through other means, or just publish them using another account, but it would take a while.
I am terribly sorry for the issue. 

Best,
Haotian
