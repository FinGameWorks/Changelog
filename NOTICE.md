Apps from FinGameWorks and its sub-accounts (Contrail Software), 
including Diffuse, Skyline, Metropolis, Vortex, etc, were removed by Google following with complete account termination. 
I personally think it is not fair as I am proud of my indie apps, and I don't think there is any shady stuff or wrongdoing in my accounts. 
I tried to file an appeal, but obviously, Google Play rejects it without giving details and states their decision is final. 
(please follow this thread: https://twitter.com/JustZht/status/1432794022607671299) 
I am still trying to get my apps back through other means, or just publish them using another account, but it would take a while.

For refunds, I am still trying to find a way to make a refund because once the account is terminated, 
I can only log into the policy page saying my account is effectively dead, nothing more, not even seeing historical download and purchase data.

I am terribly sorry for the issue. 

Best,

UPDATE:
As of 09/06/2021, Diffuse is up again as [a new app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justzht.lwp.diffuse) through re-submission. Other apps will be re-submitted, if time and situation permit.
